The purpose of this project is to develop a Python program that allows two players to play a digital version of a variant of Kwasiada Frankaa a traditional popular game in Ghana using a graphical user interface. The program will implement the rules of the game and enable players to make their moves by placing their game pieces on the game board. The program will also keep track of the game state and determine the winner once a player creates a line of three in a row. The aim of the project is to provide a user-friendly and interactive platform for playing Kwasiada.
User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button.

Once the user hits the "Run" button, the game should start running. The user will first see an empty 3x3 grid displayed on the screen. Player 1, represented by "X", will be prompted to make the first move. They can select a position on the grid. Once they make their move, the updated grid will be displayed with the "X" at the chosen position.

Then it's Player 2's turn, which is the computer represented by "O". They will be prompted to make a move by generating random rows and columns on the grid, and their move will also be displayed on the grid.

The game will continue like this, with players taking turns until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the game ends in a tie if all the spaces on the grid are filled without a winner.

Once the game is over, the program will display the winner (if there is one). The user can then choose to play again or exit the program.
